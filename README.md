# MunchIIT

Our project MunchIIT aims to develop a user-friendly website for our College canteen (@`IIT_Dharwad`) to help reduce waiting times and ease congestion during peak hours. There are two different interfaces for Admin Side and Customer Side. Whenever a customer (basically, any of our college student/staff/faculty) places an order with successful payment, an `OTP` is generated which is visible to only the customer and the Admin.  We've included `Order Tracking` feature as well so that customer can check from time-to-time to know the status and the customer also will receive corresponding automated messages. Just before the order is about to complete, person handling the admin account will simply click on the send button located near the corresponding order and an automated message will be delivered to the customer, stating that the customer can come and collect the order, after successful OTP verification. This significantly reduces the waiting time keeping in view the strictly increasing population in the college from the past few years.
